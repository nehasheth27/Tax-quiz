Tax Quest: Global Edition — Playable Browser Quiz
===============================================

What's included:
- index.html : single-page quiz app (HTML/CSS/JS) with 35 international tax questions.
- README.md  : this file with hosting instructions.

How to run locally:
1. Unzip the package and open `index.html` in any modern browser (Chrome, Edge, Firefox, Safari).
2. The app uses Local Storage to save your "coins" and level.

How to host publicly (two quick options):

A) GitHub Pages (free)
1. Create a new GitHub repository (public).
2. Upload the files (index.html and README.md).
3. In repository Settings -> Pages, choose 'main' branch and root folder, save.
4. GitHub will publish a public URL like https://<your-username>.github.io/<repo-name> within a minute.

B) Netlify (free tier -> faster)
1. Sign up at https://www.netlify.com.
2. Drag & drop the zip or the folder into Sites -> Deploys (Drag & Drop).
3. Netlify will give you a public URL immediately.

If you'd like, I can:
- Provide a ZIP file with the project for download.
- Walk you through publishing it to GitHub Pages or Netlify step-by-step.
- Add analytics, theming, or a backend to save scores server-side.

Enjoy — and tell me if you want more questions, categories, or features (timed tournaments, leaderboards, PDF export of explanations).
